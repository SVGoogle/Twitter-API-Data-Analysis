    "# Introduction\n",
    "The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user *@dog_rates*, also known as *WeRateDogs*. *WeRateDogs* is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because \"they're good dogs Brent.\" *WeRateDogs* has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "Goal: wrangle *WeRateDogs* Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for \"Wow!\"-worthy analyses and visualizations.\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "**Enhanced Twitter Archive**\n",
    "\n",
    "The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog \"stage\" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive \"enhanced.\" Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).\n",
    "I extracted this data programmatically, but I didn't do a very good job. The ratings probably aren't all correct. Same goes for the dog names and probably dog stages (see below for more information on these) too. You'll need to assess and clean these columns if you want to use them for analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key points\n",
    "Key points to keep in mind when data wrangling for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You only want original ratings (no retweets) that have images. Though there are 5000+ tweets in the dataset, not all are dog ratings and some are retweets.\n",
    "* Assessing and cleaning the entire dataset completely would require a lot of time, and is not necessary to practice and demonstrate your skills in data wrangling. Therefore, the requirements of this project are only to assess and clean at least 8 quality issues and at least 2 tidiness issues in this dataset.\n",
    "* Cleaning includes merging individual pieces of data according to the rules of tidy data.\n",
    "* The fact that the rating numerators are greater than the denominators does not need to be cleaned. This unique rating system is a big part of the popularity of WeRateDogs.\n",
    "* You do not need to gather the tweets beyond August 1st, 2017. You can, but note that you won't be able to gather the image predictions for these tweets since you don't have access to the algorithm used."

    "# Part I - Gathering Data\n",
    "The relevant data is retrieved by getting each of the three pieces of data as described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The *WeRateDogs* Twitter archive. I am giving this file to you, so imagine it as a file on hand. Download this file manually by clicking the following link: [twitter_archive_enhanced.csv](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59a4e958_twitter-archive-enhanced/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The tweet image predictions, i.e., what breed of dog (or other object, animal, etc.) is present in each tweet according to a neural network. This file `image_predictions.tsv` is hosted on Udacity's servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Additionaly, each tweet's retweet count and favorite (\"like\") count at minimum is gathered. Using the tweet IDs in the *WeRateDogs* Twitter archive, we query the Twitter API for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library and store each tweet's entire set of JSON data in a file called `tweet_json.txt` file. Each tweet's JSON data is written to its own line. Then this .txt file is read line by line into a pandas DataFrame."

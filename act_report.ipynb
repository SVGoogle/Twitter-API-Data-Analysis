    "If you like dogs, you are at the right place! This post is an introduction to a must-follow Twitter account for every dog-lover out there even if you are not a dog-person like me. It is @dog_rates, also known as [*WeRateDogs*](https://twitter.com/dog_rates?s=20). *WeRateDogs* is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because ***\"they're good dogs Brent.\"*** *WeRateDogs* has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.\n",
